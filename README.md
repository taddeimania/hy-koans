# Hy Koans

### Warning: WORK IN PROGRESS

I am developing this project as a way to get more familiar with [Hy](http://hylang.org).

It is not clear whether this will be a straight port of [Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) 
or [Clojure Koans](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans) or just a new Koans project all in itself
to identify the Hy language specifics (after all - Hy is still python).

Please feel free to give feedback in the issues or contribute a pull request.  The main reason for this is to learn
new things. :beer:
